# sampleJSONData
This repo is used for helping in integration of Backend API Data to Frontend on other projects. The sample JSON data used is not at all someone's personal information! If at all it the data coincides with the actual personal or even sensitive data it is purely a coincidence, it is just a coincidence and I/we is/are not responsible for anything.
